_Please change the above to DONE when you finish and want the assignment to be graded!_

Due the night of Nov 15 at midnight


## Instructions
The homework pdf has the basic instructions, and you should definitely read the docstrings, but here are some additional guidelines:
 - [ ] Add code to the template functions in `Prob1.py` to process and display a graph of the temperature and humidity inside a camera enclosure over the course of 5 days.
 - [ ] Add code to the template functions in `Prob2.py` to create an animation of a primitive car bouncing back and forth in the window.

__Remember to fill out the commented metadata at the top of each Python script please!__

#### Testing
 - Auto-testing on these is more limited due to their graphical nature. If I can come up with some basic tests, I'll add them at a later date, but at the moment these will just be visual checks.
